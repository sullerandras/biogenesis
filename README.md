# biogenesis
Biogenesis simulates in a visual fashion the processes involved in the evolution of unicellular organisms at nature.

There's an active community on discord: https://discord.com/channels/815435382094168076/815435382564978690

MarcoDBAA from discord actively works on adding new colors and other features to Biogenesis.

I made some performance improvements so the simulation runs a bit faster. Most of my changes have been merged into MarcoDBAA's version, so part of the "official" release.

I'm also working on some stuff that i'm interested in, see those in the https://github.com/sullerandras/biogenesis/tree/andras-patches branch. Not very well documented i'm afraid.
