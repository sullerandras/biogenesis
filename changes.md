Changes that I've added on top of MarcoDBAA's source:
- Update statistics regularly (controlled by `Utils.STATISTICS_REFRESH_FPS`)
- Update status bar regularly (controlled by `Utils.STATUS_BAR_REFRESH_FPS`)
- Set min digits to 1 in status bar
- Make color panel narrower so it can fit on the screen with the main frame
- Stop repainting the world if the window is not in focus
- Set statistics window’s minimum size to the current window size. This seem to make it less jumpy when the `Remains of beings` number has different number of digits
- Change scroll unit increment to make it easier to scroll on a macbook
- Show number of clades in status bar and statistics
- Add parameter for the "repaint strategy". Defaults to “repaint if any of the app window is in focus”.
- Limit FPS to the target FPS when game is repainted. The FPS is unlimited when the world is not repainted (e.g. in the background).
- Save world as png when doing auto backup
