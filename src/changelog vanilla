biogenesis (0.9) by MarcoDBAA (0.8 and earlier by Joan Queralt);

  0.9 v2:
  * Fixed a bug, where the web link to the game manuals was not working.
  * Fixed a bug, where organisms could be "born" with 0 segments
    and disappear immediately. Therefore:
  * Through mutation organisms can have between 1 and 100 genes (was 1- 840 segments) 
  
  0.9 v1:
  * STRtrees (by Vivid Solutions) implemented by Richard David Williams
    to make the simulation run much faster.
  * Better function to create random organisms, independent from symmetry.
  * Through mutation organisms can have between 1 and 840 segments (was 4-64)
  * Fixed a bug where organisms disappeared from the world after a collision, 
    or immediately at birth (if they were very small).
  * Fixed a bug, where you couldn't change the value for the parameter 
    "Energy lost by dead organisms".
  * Fixed a bug, where the statistics window didn't work in empty worlds.
  * German translation by MarcoDBAA
  * Portuguese translation by Mauricio Leonardi
  * Russian translation by Alexey Loginov
  
  P.S: 
  * These are just small changes and bug fixes for Joan Queralts 0.8 version,
    limited like that, so that the user manual is still up to date.
  * Check out my "Color Mod" or AdaMs "X Mod" (both included in extra folders), 
    if you want to have new content (there is much) for biogenesis.

  * Changed default parameters to have a smaller and faster world.
  * Remove Vectors and convert them to Lists.
  * Added comments in many files.
  * Some speed optimization.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented some corpses to disappear.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the initial organisms number from being saved
  between sessions.

  was showed before the organism died.
  * Updated documentation.
  * Other minor details.

biogenesis (0.4);

  * Added Spanish translation (program and documentation).
  * Added a genetic code editor (genetic laboratory).
  * Now the application can act as an applet as well.
  * Added an option to save a JPG image of an organism.
  * Added status bar with basic world statistics.
  * Added an option to launch the web browser at the manual page.
  * Added an option to check the last released version.
  * Added new parameters to control the probability of a color appearing in a
  segment and the energy cost that using each color implies.
  * Added a tab in the parameters window to configure these parameters.
  * Added options to increase or decrease the carbon dioxide in a running world.
  * Added an option to disperse all corpses back into the environment.
  * Adapted to Java 5 and compiled for this version. This makes execution faster.
  * Changed the mutation rate parameter to allow values lesser than 1%.
  * Changed the way genetic codes are saved and restored. Now exported files are
  in XML.
  * Fixed a bug that makes organisms with more than 64 segments appear when the
  symmetry mutates.
  * Fixed a bug that makes the visible world to be bigger than the world when world
  size changed.
  * Increased the unit increment of scroll bars to facilitate navigation.
  * Updated about window to give some more information.
  * Updated documentation.
  * Other minor details.

biogenesis (0.3);

  * Started internationalization process.
  * Added English translation (program and documentation).
  * Menu bar instead of buttons.
  * Added a lot of user interaction.
  * Changed organism's metabolisms: processes are more realistic now.
  * Added oxygen and carbon dioxide instead of abstract substances.
  * Changed the meaning of some segment colors.
  * Now corpses remain in the world while they have energy.
  * Since carbon is constant in the world, population stabilizes and doesn't keep growing for ever.
